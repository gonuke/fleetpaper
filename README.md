The latex and related files for generating the paper are in this root
directory (i.e. paper.tex, refs.bib, etc.).  All the artifacts and
instructions for generating results are in the ``exp2`` subdirectory.  The
``Makefile`` contains some commands that do some auto-generation of figures
from data/files in ``exp2``.
